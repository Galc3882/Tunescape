Maybe the market isn't exactly as we think it is. Maybe target music influencers?

It might be hard to convert someone who is in Spotify

Maybe start more niece (like and add-on) for hyper-enthusiasts. Helping people curate the perfect playlists for them.

Lots of competition against Spotify and other services. 

Is there enough data to recommend the right music?

Make it the Watpad of music, make a house that looks at recommending new artists, or 

James:

Make it a very inexpensive addon ($1 a month) (freemium a few songs a day). $1, can provide extra features with money.

Alan:

Sell information and demographics for advertisement

Branko:

Very useful to a very specific group of people. 

Joseph:

Could be interesting to build another service house
