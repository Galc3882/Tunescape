Can we show examples of adds?

Alan McMillan:
Why do we not have Spotify and Apple Music?
> The 3 services there have more "asoteric" listening experiences.

Steve Lamont:
Encourage: Talk about what our headline is going to be. Few sentences, test to ee if it works. 
Going to market with advertising is one of the most difficult parts of this. 
Spotify wants to have the right mix of music to keep people happy, but also want to keep the amount they pay artists under control.
If our app lets people enjoy cheaper music, then we might be able to sell this idea to spotify.

Balaji Gopalan:
Likes the first 30 seconds of pitch, reminded him of "Band of the Day". 
Genre of music is going to have a huge impact on what we do.
Pop is based on artist recomendation. Classical is very different.

Music is evolving to have the hook earlier. 
Monitize directly. 

Cheapest, Most Premium, Most Focused

Genre: Classical is more validated. How should we approach validation? Too many genres.
Pop music may not be a good market because they may be satisfied with the status quo.
Jazz may have similar music.
