Why Subscription?

## Market Validation is very important. Is there actually a problem??
> Tell them we are confident that we have a problem, but this is our plan going forward in the next four weeks (Put that onto the slides).

## Why are current algorithms repetitive?
> Use the words I mentioned like it groups you, and bounces the top 40 music selection. It is like an echo chamber that we are trying to eliminate

We need more facts and sources.

## Also,
- Tunescape saves the day (branding is coming together)
- good timeline

Genevieve:
- How detailed should we be detailed
- explain where you got the numbers from
- have explanation for why we should have an add-on instead of a streaming service

- have you created a technology in search of a problem?
- Kevin: allocate 3 hour chunks and go out to certain locations to talk to people
- have honed in onto a true problem
- that people are willing to pay for this type of service
- over next x weeks, will talk to x people to validate it

- mention why current streaming algorithms are repetitive 
- time: we have some leeway

- would there be a market for distributors?


- captivation & credibility
- more data as long as you can get it into the narrative
- donâ€™t want to do a massive data dump
- story
