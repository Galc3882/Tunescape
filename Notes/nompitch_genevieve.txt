Feedback from Genevieve re. our Nomination Pitch
Genevieve Notes
SUBSTANCE
- consistent, communicate in a way that ppl understand
- differentiation of algorithm
- market slide: our 3 segmented markets, our three market segments
- saying + seeing that’s not matching
- we did our market sounding, 3 identifiable segments feel out of that
- show that we did the market sounding work

- algorithm: this is why it’s so important, this is why it’s so unique

STYLE
- from before: transitions, cue cards synched with script
- Micol needs to wear a blue shirt
- flow: we always come in on the same side, come out on the same side
- anticipated layout: screen and then 1 and 1 on either side
- choreography is important
- Micol: be lit from the down up
- ideally: would have a big Lightbox
- go through the feel concept doc, make sure you’ve answered every single line, objective

- x% prefer us over Spotify, put it with the 70% stat
- + R&D on the front end of this venture will allow us to refine the product
- don’t lead with your vulnerabilities
- lead with offensive constructive piece
- "our marketing sounding to date has great promise, and …^^^"
- sell the potential
- don’t ever be defensive
